# Slideshow-backend

A supabase-based backend for realtime slideshow-interactions.

## Motivation

Event after the times of Covid, remote presentations are usual. This leaves the presenter detached from the audience by default.
Slideshow aims at bridging this gap between presenter and audience.

## What it ~~does~~ shall do in future

- Provide [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)-alike options for interacting with the audience.
- Aggregate reactions, questions and so on in real time for the presenter so that (s)he can react even while giving the presentation.
- Provide statistics after the presentation has ended, so that thre presenter can adjust for a subsequent presentation.

## Stack

- Supabase for state-oriented features.
- Do it the supabase way: Use DB-inbuilt-features wherever possible (RLS, constraints, defaults, database functions)

## Status

Big WIP. It's a side project of a father with two children. Expect not much progress.

## How to get involved

Add an issue to get in touch.
